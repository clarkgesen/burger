# burger
An app that allows users to create burgers to add to a list. If the burger has been eaten, there is a button to press, labeled "devoured", that will move the burger to a list of all the burgers that have been eaten. All burgers are stored in a database, with the name, an id number, and a boolean that represents if the burger has been eaten or not.
